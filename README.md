# Java-Junk
A bunch of random projects I do in java while trying to use it more.
Some of these wont actually do anything and the older they are the worse they'll likely look. 

I'll be trying to uplad each project as its own directory with packages and other resources. Sometimes its just a .java files because it is a simple script.
